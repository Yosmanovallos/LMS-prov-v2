# Provana Help Center — Project Guide (CLAUDE.md)

An interactive, multi-view frontend prototype of a Jira Service Management–style customer Help Center portal, fully rebranded for Provana. Built as a single-page React app (inline JSX via Babel) with state-driven routing across 6 views. No build step — open the HTML file directly.

 Rebranding note this is an original, Provana-branded portal. All NeostellaJira Service Management branding from the source references has been replaced (e.g. the footer reads Powered by Provana Service Management).

## Brand & Design System

 Token  Value  Usage 
---------
 `--purple`  `#4A2E80`  Primary brand color — titles, links, buttons, active states 
 `--purple-700`  `#3c2568`  Button hover 
 `--purple-soft`  `#6d3fb0`  Accent  gradients 
 `--teal`  `#34d6a5`  Accent (avatar, dot-network graphic, brand mark) 
 `--magenta`  `#ec4899`  Accent (dot-network graphic, brand mark) 
 `--ink`  `--ink-2`  `--muted`  `#172b4d`  `#44546f`  `#626f86`  Text hierarchy 
 `--line`  `--line-2`  `#e4e6eb`  `#dfe1e6`  Borders 

- Font Inter (Google Fonts), weights 400–800.
- Logo `assetsprovana-logo.png` (purple wordmark + teal→magenta dot-spiral). Used in the nav.
- Signature graphic an animated teal→magenta dot-network (`HeroNetwork`) that riffs on Provana's dot-spiral logo. Generated procedurally with a seeded RNG so it's stable. Appears in the hero (View 1) and the slim banner (Views 2356).
- Status badge colors blue (`#deebff``#0747a6`) for IN REVIEW  CUSTOMER FEEDBACK  IN DEVELOPMENT; green (`#d3f5e4``#006644`) for APPROVED  UAT.
- All colors live as CSS custom properties in the `style` block of `Provana Help Center.html`.

## File Structure

```
Provana Help Center.html      ← main shell style (all CSS), font + ReactBabel script tags, view includes
assetsprovana-logo.png       ← Provana wordmark (transparent PNG)
app
  icons.jsx                   ← all SVG icon components (stroke-based, currentColor)
  shared.jsx                  ← ProvanaLogo, Monogram (gold B), Avatar, HeroNetwork
  view-portal.jsx             ← VIEW 1 + Breadcrumbs + TopNav (hosts the profile dropdown  VIEW 4)
  view-requests.jsx           ← VIEW 2 + PortalBanner + FormCrumbs
  view-form.jsx               ← VIEW 3 (the New Report form + RTE rich-text editor)
  view-account.jsx            ← VIEW 5 (Profile) + VIEW 6 (Requests table)
  app.jsx                     ← App router + view transitions + ReactDOM mount
screenshots                  ← scratch captures (not part of the app)
```

### Why split into files
Each `script type=textbabel` is transpiled in global scope, so top-level `function``const` declarations become global. Components are explicitly published via `Object.assign(window, {...})` at the end of each file so later scripts can use them. Script load order matters (see bottom of the HTML) `icons → shared → view-portal → view-requests → view-form → view-account → app`.

## Views & Routing

Routing is a single `view` string in `App` (`app.jsx`), persisted to `localStorage` under key `provana_view`. `go(next)` triggers a brief fade-out, swaps the view, resets scroll, then fades back in.

 `view` value  Component  Description 
---------
 `portal`  `ViewPortal`  VIEW 1 — Help Center breadcrumb strip, nav, dark hero w dot-network + search, 3 portal cards, recent forms row 
 `requests`  `ViewRequests`  VIEW 2 — BLG - Power BI Requests request-type list (7 items, distinct icons) 
 `form`  `ViewForm`  VIEW 3 — New Report request form (13 fields, 2 WYSIWYG editors, dropzone, SendCancel) 
 `profile`  `ViewProfile`  VIEW 5 — Profile page (avatar + Personal details + Languagetime zone) 
 `myrequests`  `ViewRequestsList`  VIEW 6 — Requests data table (8 mock rows, status badges, priority chevrons, live search) 

VIEW 4 (profile dropdown) is not a route — it's a popover inside `TopNav` (in `view-portal.jsx`), toggled by the YO avatar, closes on outside-click.

### Navigation map
- View 1 BLG - Power BI Requests card → View 2; recent-forms row → View 2
- View 2 New Report list item → View 3
- View 3 Send  Cancel → back to View 2
- TopNav avatar → View 4 dropdown → Requests → View 6, Profile → View 5, Log out → View 1
- TopNav logo & all breadcrumbs (Provana Customer Portal) → back up the hierarchy
- The avatar dropdown, logo, and search live in the shared `TopNav` and are present on every view.

---

## Key Components & Interactivity

- `TopNav({ go })` (`view-portal.jsx`) — clickable logo (→ portal), search button, avatar with profile dropdown. Shared across all views.
- `HeroNetwork` (`shared.jsx`) — animated SVG dot constellation; deterministic via seeded RNG; teal→magenta color interpolation.
- `Monogram` (`shared.jsx`) — navy circular badge with gold serif B (BLG portals).
- `RTE({ variant })` (`view-form.jsx`) — contentEditable rich-text editor with a toolbar. `variant=full` (GoalAudience fields) vs `variant=alt` (Additional Notes) show different toolbar buttons. Uses `document.execCommand` for bolditaliclists.
- `ViewForm` — fully controlled form state behalf-of chip (clearable ×), text inputs, radio group (YesNoUnsureNA), environment checkboxes, custom Priority & Pages dropdowns, share-with tag, native date picker (text↔date swap), drag-and-drop file dropzone with file list.
- `ViewRequestsList` — table data in `REQ_ROWS`; status→color map in `STATUS`; `Priority` component renders single red chevron (High) or stacked double chevron (Highest); the Request contains… search live-filters rows by summaryreference.

---

## Conventions

- Canonical HTML — explicit closing tags, double-quoted attributes (so the direct editor works).
- Flexgrid + `gap` for layout spacing, not inline-flow margins.
- Icons are stroke-based React components in `icons.jsx`, sized via `size` prop, colored via `currentColor`.
- Styles — one `style` block in the HTML using CSS custom properties; no inline styles except dynamiccomputed values in `shared.jsx``view-account.jsx`.
- View transitions — resting state is always `opacity 1` (never gate visibility on an animation completing, to avoid blank frames when the preview iframe is throttled). Only the `.out` class fades.
- ReactBabel — pinned versions with integrity hashes in the HTML; do not bump or unpin.
- Keep files  ~1000 lines; add new views as their own `appview-.jsx` and register on `window`.

---

## How to Run  Edit
- Open `Provana Help Center.html` directly (no build).
- To reset the landing view clear `localStorage['provana_view']` or set it to `portal`.
- Adding a view create `appview-x.jsx`, publish components via `Object.assign(window, …)`, add a `script` include (before `app.jsx`), and add a branch in the `App` router in `app.jsx`.
